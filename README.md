This project page will maintain the arduino code required to operate the Nyx Tracker in the northern hemisphere. 

The Nyx Tracker runs on an Arduino Nano microcontroller with a laser/motor/switch hat - these two boards are soldered together during assembly. 
The Nano can be reprogrammed at any time using the Arduino IDE (standard communication settings for an Arduino Nano).
